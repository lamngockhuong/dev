> Hi! Glad to see you here. I'm Khuong
{: .prompt-tip }

I created this site firstly for my personal note taking and now, I wanna share it with you. For me, people cannot remember everything, you must take note what you have learnt. It‚Äôs useful if you can put your note online and you are able to see it everytime, everywhere with just a phone. That‚Äôs the reason why this site was born.
